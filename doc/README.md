Nito Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Nito Core is the original Nito client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Nito transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Nito Core, visit [nito.network](https://nito.network/#Downloads).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Nito Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/nito-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/nitod` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run nito-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Nito Core to your applications folder, and then run Nito Core.
